# Course-Management-System

I have created a webapp which helps students and faculties to manage courses.

---The SignUp---
New users can add their details and select if they are students or faculties, accordingly the respective home pages open
username for each user is required to be unique.

---The student features---
student can view
-List of Registered courses
-List of available courses
The student can click on available courses and register to the new ones and de-register from the already registered courses


----The faculty features----
faculties can view
-List of all available courses
The faculty can click on available courses and see the course details and delete the course
The faculty can also add new courses or delete existing courses


-----The courses-----
Each course has a start date and if the course start date has passed and number of registered students <5, the course becomes inactive
once the course starts new users can't register the course
